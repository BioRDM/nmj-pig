IMMUNOFLUORESCENT VISUALISATION OF THE NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION
Gillingwater Lab – Ines Boehm, June 2021

Prepare Solutions
- Permeabilisation Buffer: 4% Triton-X in 1xPBS
- Blocking Buffer: 4% BSA (Bovine Serum Albumine) 2% Triton-X in 1xPBS
- (for a species when using antibodies raised in same species e.g. mouse with mouse antibodies) Triton-X free Blocking Buffer: 4% BSA in 1x PBS
- 0.1 M Glycine pH 10.4 (quenches autofluorescence and helps with background signal)
- Storage of tissue: 0.01% Sodium Azide (long term storage, prevent bacterial growth)

Antibodies
- TRITC-aBTX – Tetramethylrhodamin alpha-Bungarotoxin (cat no: BTIU00012, VWR International Ltd.)
- 1°: mouse monoclonal SV2 and 2H3 (1:50; DSHB)
- 2°: AlexaFluor-488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse H+L IgG antibody (1:400, A21202, Life Technologies)

Sample preparation
Tissue fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1-4h depending on size of dissected muscle

- Fine dissection of fibre bundle (10-15 fibres per bundle) & cleaning removal of connective tissue & fat (connective tissue & fat contributes a lot to background signal)
- All incubation steps to be undertaken on a rocker to allow better permeabilisation and penetration of antibodies.
- Glycine (0.1 M pH 10.4) for 15 min to reduce tissue auto-fluorescence
- 15' 1xPBS wash
- 15’ 1:500 TRITC-aBTX in 1xPBS
- Trim fibres to endplate bands using an upright fluorescent microscope (if fibres are too long, this allows for quicker finding of NMJs at large magnification during confocal microscopy)
- 1 ½ h in permeabilisation buffer
- ½ h in blocking buffer
- 1° antibodies: 1:50 anti-ms SV2/2H3 in blocking buffer O/N @ 4°C ( ~18h) 
- 4x20’ 1xPBS wash
- 2° antibodies: 1:400 dk α-ms Alexa-488 in 1xPBS 2h @ RT or O/N @ 4°C
- 4x20’ 1xPBS wash
- Mount in Mowiol on slides under a microscope, using forceps to spread out fibres and ensuring fibres do not overlay each other (Make sure to NOT introduce bubbles! These can be popped using forceps)
- Store slides at -20° for long storage and when not imaged instantly, avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles if slides are not imaged immediately
